# Digital_Timer

Alarms are used in any Embedded systems to communicate critical event in the system. Timers play a critical role in this, which can be understood by implementing applications like personal alarm clock. The goal of this project is to blow alarm depending on the configuration set by the user (ex: daily / weekly / particular day). Eight various options are provided to facilitate this. Focus is also making it user-friendly with LCD, I2C RTC, digital keypad and LEDâ€™s for user interfaces like menus, display time etc.
